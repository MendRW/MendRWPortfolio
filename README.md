# MendRWPortfolio

The purpose of this project is to track and catalogue my projects and learning. I'll try and keep it neat but it really is just for my own personal documentation so forgive the chaos.

Other documentation and process of development can be seen on my youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/@Mendxd
I'll include a more detailed run down of my thoughts and progress here

This project is not intended to be copied or used if you're curious then by all means take a look.

This project is designed to run along side a youtube channel where I will document and track my progress.

Please reach out to me on discord @mend.
with any questions, suggestions or projects. Even just to have a chat about SWE

Thank you for taking the time to view and please reach out if you're curious about anything or have some feedback for me.

Take care !_!
